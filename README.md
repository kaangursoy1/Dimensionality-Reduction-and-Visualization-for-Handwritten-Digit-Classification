# Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Visualization-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
# Overview
This project explores the use of dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance the performance of a Gaussian classifier in recognizing handwritten digits. The dataset used contains 5,000 samples, each representing a 20x20 digit image transformed into a 400-dimensional vector. The project aims to compare the effects of different dimensionality reduction techniques—Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Isomap, and t-SNE—on model performance and visualization.

# Key Objectives
Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to project high-dimensional data onto lower-dimensional subspaces.
Train a Gaussian classifier using the transformed data and evaluate its performance.
Visualize high-dimensional data using t-SNE to better understand data distribution.
# Implementation Details
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is used to project 400-dimensional data onto subspaces of varying dimensions, analyzing its effect on classification accuracy.
The performance is evaluated based on the test error, with the optimal subspace dimension determined to be 63, yielding a test error of 0.1620.
PCA provides an effective linear reduction technique, simplifying the dataset while maintaining significant features.
# Isomap

Isomap is used as a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to maintain geodesic distances in the reduced-dimensional space.
The best results are obtained at 84 dimensions, with a test error of 0.1496, indicating better performance than PCA for this specific dataset.
# t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

t-SNE is employed for visualizing high-dimensional data in a 2D space.
The results reveal clear separation among digit classes, demonstrating t-SNE’s capability to preserve the underlying structure of high-dimensional data during reduction.
# Results
PCA: Achieved optimal performance with 63 dimensions and a test error of 0.1620.
Isomap: Reached a test error of 0.1496 at 84 dimensions, slightly outperforming PCA.
t-SNE Visualization: Successfully mapped the dataset to a 2D space, with clear separation of digit classes, although some overlapping classes were observed.
# Challenges
Optimal Dimension Selection: Determining the ideal number of components for each method to balance accuracy and computational efficiency while avoiding overfitting.
Method Understanding: Implementing each reduction technique effectively in Python and interpreting results accurately.
t-SNE Overlap: Managing class overlap when reducing data to 2 dimensions, inherent in visualization tasks.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of dimensionality reduction in improving computational efficiency and accuracy of classification models while revealing data structures through visualization. The results highlight that while PCA is effective for linear reduction, Isomap offers better accuracy, and t-SNE excels in visualization.
